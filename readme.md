# opengl-stm32
openGL on STM32
## Description

This project implements the OpenGL standard on an STM32 microcontroller, specifically the STM32F429 Discovery Board (STM32F429I-DISC1), which features a 320x240 TFT-LCD display. Using a combination of HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) drivers and BSP (Board Support Package) provided by STMicroelectronics, this project aims to render OpenGL graphics on the STM32 platform.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following tools and components:

* STM32F429I-DISC1: This is the development board used for this project.

* STM32 VS Code Extension: This extension integrates the STM32 development tools into Visual Studio Code.
